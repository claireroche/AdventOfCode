In each folder, you'll find my python code for solving the two parts of the daily puzzles.
For instance, if you want to run the code of day 1, for the first part of the puzzle, using your data set stored in a file _mydata.txt_, use this command line:
`python3 day01_puzzle1.py mydata.txt`  
In this repository, the code corresponding to the second part of the daily puzzles are named `day01_puzzle2.py`.
